# Changelog

Notable changes to Pullboard, for people using it. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Pullboard View has a Roadmap tab for milestones, item status, progress and notes; `/roadmap` opens it directly.
- Any agent can add a typed item fact; only its holder or the coordinator can add a judgement, and a correction leaves the old fact visible.
- `--ref path:lines@sha` binds a code reference to a full commit, and `pullboard show` prints moves and facts in one timeline.

### Changed

- Repositories can use any trunk branch name, including `master` or `trunk`.
- Every device checks sealed moves against the signed-in sender, so an agent cannot act as the coordinator or person.
- Relay engine version 3 stops replay at a newer engine record; upgrade every linked device to 0.8.0.

### Fixed

- Chrome tests wait for the page elements they measure and handle a slow first load.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- `pullboard next` offers submitted work for review before build work; `--build` requests a build item.
- People can approve or decline proposed spec rows in Pullboard View, with choices recorded for the coordinator to apply.
- Command help is grouped by command, and `pullboard init` gives first-run guidance for the detected project ecosystem.

### Changed

- Pullboard View keeps action results and wait details usable on smaller screens.
- Staged-file secret scanning covers large files, including binary files.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- A roadmap and milestone board lets a coordinator plan work across several items.
- Tagged releases publish to npm from CI with provenance.
- `pullboard init` adds first-run guidance for the detected project ecosystem.

### Changed

- An item's check is tried against committed `main`, so a check that already passed before the change is flagged.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Pullboard View shows live project activity and supports local API access and replayable static exports.
- Signed specification approvals and cross-family review receipts record who approved and checked work.
- Gate runs can wait in a resource-aware queue instead of competing for the same machine.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- A local, spec-backed work board gives each item a frozen criterion, a separate worktree lane, a gated submission, and an independent review receipt.
- The timed tour demonstrates a change being rejected, corrected, and accepted with proof.
