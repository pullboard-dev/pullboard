# Changelog

Notable changes to Pullboard, for people using it. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pullboard next` can suggest a submitted item for review; `pullboard next --build` explicitly asks for build work.

### Changed

- Staged-file secret scanning now covers large files, including binary files.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- A roadmap and milestone board lets a coordinator plan work across several items.
- Tagged releases publish to npm from CI with provenance.
- `pullboard init` adds first-run guidance for the detected project ecosystem.

### Changed

- An item's check is tried against committed `main`, so a check that already passed before the change is flagged.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Pullboard View shows live project activity and supports local API access and replayable static exports.
- Signed specification approvals and cross-family review receipts record who approved and checked work.
- Gate runs can wait in a resource-aware queue instead of competing for the same machine.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- A local, spec-backed work board gives each item a frozen criterion, a separate worktree lane, a gated submission, and an independent review receipt.
- The timed tour demonstrates a change being rejected, corrected, and accepted with proof.
