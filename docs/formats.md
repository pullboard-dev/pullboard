# File formats

This page describes the text files people edit and the SQLite board kept inside `.git`. The row parser is in `src/spec.js`; board declarations and migrations are in `src/board.js`; lifecycle guards are generated from `src/machine.js`.

## SPEC.md and PRACTICE.md

Both files use the shared row grammar in `src/spec.js`, whose version is `SPEC_GRAMMAR_VERSION`. Either file may declare the current version on its own line as `<!-- pullboard-grammar N -->`; without a marker, the file uses the current grammar. A marker inside a fenced code example is ignored. The parser accepts only the version it reads and refuses a mismatched or invalid marker with `A5_GRAMMAR_VERSION`; upgrade Pullboard or use a file written for its grammar. Pullboard does not rewrite these files during an upgrade.

A section begins with `## `; a row must be beneath a section and occupies one line:

```text
- ID [status[, tier]] requirement text | gate: <command> | serves: <ID, ID> | signers: <principal, principal>
```

The identifier expression, statuses and tiers below come from the parser:

<!-- id-pattern:start -->
| Identifier | Parser expression |
| --- | --- |
| `ID` | `^[A-Za-z]+\d+(?:\.\d+)*$` |
<!-- id-pattern:end -->

<!-- statuses:start -->
| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `approved` | decided and in force |
| `draft` | proposed, not decided |
| `pending` | open question |
| `fact` | true today |
| `wont` | not building; the row stays permanent |
| `retired` | no longer in force; the row stays permanent |
<!-- statuses:end -->

<!-- tiers:start -->
| Tier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `must` | An approved must row names a gate. Other statuses may omit it. |
| `aim` | An aim; no gate is required. |
<!-- tiers:end -->

After the requirement text, `gate:` names the check, `serves:` names comma-separated ids, and `signers:` names comma-separated SSH principals; each field may be omitted. Signers must be unique and contain no spaces or commas, and list the exact principals required for signed sign-offs. Other trailing keys are recorded as unknown and rejected by `spec check`. A malformed row-like line is an error, and rows inside fenced code blocks are examples rather than input. IDs are permanent: mark a cut row `wont` or `retired` instead of deleting it.

The row object returned by `parseSpec` has these fields:

`parseSpec` also returns `grammarVersion`, equal to `SPEC_GRAMMAR_VERSION` after the file's marker has been checked.

<!-- parser-fields:start -->
| Parsed field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Stable row identifier. |
| `status` | One token from the status list. |
| `tier` | Optional second token: must or aim. |
| `text` | Requirement text before trailing fields. |
| `gate` | Check named by gate, or an empty string. |
| `serves` | Comma-separated ids named by serves, or an empty list. |
| `signers` | Comma-separated SSH principals named by signers, or an empty list. |
| `unknown` | Unrecognized trailing fields; spec check reports them. |
| `section` | Containing ## heading. |
| `line` | 1-based source line. |
<!-- parser-fields:end -->

## SQLite board schema

The board file is in the repository's Git common directory at `.git/pullboard/board.sqlite`. File-backed connections use WAL mode, so `board.sqlite-wal` and `board.sqlite-shm` can sit beside it while connections are open. SQLite `PRAGMA user_version` records the board schema version; it also marks whether trigger repairs are reported in the event log. Schema objects are created from `src/board.js` when a board opens.

<!-- format-versions:start -->
| Format | Version | Version source | Upgrade rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CLI JSON envelope` | `1` | `JSON_SHAPES.version` in `src/json.js` | Keep optional fields additive within version 1; bump the envelope version for incompatible command/export shapes. |
| `row grammar` | `1` | `SPEC_GRAMMAR_VERSION` in `src/spec.js`; optional `<!-- pullboard-grammar N -->` line in either file (absence means the current grammar) | Both files share the version. A declared version must match; an incompatible grammar change requires a coordinated version bump and compatible files. No automatic conversion occurs. |
| `board schema` | `2` | `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `src/board.js`, persisted as `PRAGMA user_version` | Create missing tables and indexes, add missing columns in place with declared defaults, restore missing or changed triggers, and remove stale machine triggers without replacing rows. |
| `event log` | `1` | `EVENT_LOG_VERSION` in `src/board.js`, persisted in `board_meta` as `event_log_version` | Older event-log versions upgrade in place; newer versions are refused with `EVENT_LOG_VERSION`. Preserve event rows when the board schema changes. |
| `move engine` | `3` | `ENGINE_VERSION` in `src/machine.js`, carried as `engine` in every sealed executable move | Bump when a move's meaning changes, independently of the event log and sealed envelope. A newer engine is refused with `ENGINE_VERSION`, naming both versions and asking you to upgrade Pullboard. |
<!-- format-versions:end -->

Pullboard 0.6.1 released engine 1. The first change to released move semantics raises the engine once for the next release; later changes developed before that release keep the same version. Engine 2 records a fresh explicit-build claim's skipped-review snapshot. Older clients refuse engine-2 moves before changing rows or replay cursors; engine 2 still accepts engine-1 moves.

Engine 3 checks each move or request against the relay's authenticated sender before replay. An agent token acts only as its named agent and cannot act as the person. Refused attribution attempts advance the sequence with a `relay_refusal_<sequence>` receipt and a `relay_refused` event naming the sender, attempted actor and refusal code. They change no item, shout or verdict and do not reserve the forged operation id. Snapshot restoration requires a person sender. The event log remains version 1.

A board without `event_log_version` is a legacy version-0 event log. Opening an older board writes the current marker without replacing its events. Opening a newer event log refuses with `EVENT_LOG_VERSION`, naming the stored and supported versions and asking you to upgrade Pullboard. `doctor` reports that version conflict read-only.

A native board export includes the marker in its `board_meta` rows. Import refuses a newer event-log version before changing the destination; an older export upgrades its marker in place. Static view exports put `eventLogVersion` beside the data in both `state.json` and `events.json`, separately from the API envelope's `version`.

Linked clients seal an executable operation and its deterministic inputs. The relay assigns its sequence and receipt timestamp without reading the operation. Each client runs the CLI's board engine at that timestamp. Successful results and engine refusals advance `board_meta.relay_applied_sequence` in the same transaction as the move's receipt, keyed by `relay_receipt_<operation-id>`; retries return the recorded outcome. An identical operation id and descriptor at a later relay position advances the prefix without another event and returns its first outcome. The same id with different contents is refused with `RELAY_MOVE`. `relay_engine_version` records the checkpoint's executable semantics. A future engine stops replay before either its rows or its cursor changes.

A sealed checkpoint keeps the native export tables importable and may carry the local API presentation beside them. Its public sequence equals `relay_applied_sequence`, so clients can restore a compacted prefix and continue after it. The older local-first mirror drains only its already-durable outbox, then publishes a checkpoint covering the acknowledged prefix without executing those events again. A divergent old outbox is refused with the relay and local sequences; re-link from that machine or join by pairing.

The in-place upgrade behavior is exercised by `exerciseUpgrade` in `docs/formats.test.js`:

<!-- upgrade-rules:start -->
| Older board condition | Behavior when opened |
| --- | --- |
| Missing declared tables or indexes | Create them with `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`. |
| Missing declared columns | Add each with `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` and its declared default. |
| Missing or changed declared triggers | Install the declared trigger definitions. |
| Undeclared `machine_` triggers | Drop them as stale. |
| A board that previously had guard triggers | Append a `guards` event listing missing, changed and stale trigger names. |
| An older schema version | Set `PRAGMA user_version` to the current `SCHEMA_VERSION` after installation. |
| Existing rows and event history | Keep them in the same board file; guard repair may append its `guards` event. |
<!-- upgrade-rules:end -->

An older board that has not yet recorded its guard marker receives the current triggers and marker quietly. `openBoard` does not replace the board file or existing rows.

`src/machine.js` declares the lifecycle and retained records. `src/board.js` installs these persistent triggers in the board file:

<!-- board-triggers:start -->
| Trigger | Table |
| --- | --- |
| `machine_event_delete` | `event` |
| `machine_event_update` | `event` |
| `machine_fields_claimed` | `item` |
| `machine_fields_submitted` | `item` |
| `machine_fields_verified` | `item` |
| `machine_fields_withdrawn` | `item` |
| `machine_item_delete` | `item` |
| `machine_item_move` | `item` |
| `machine_item_start` | `item` |
| `machine_item_state` | `item` |
| `machine_proof_verified` | `item` |
| `machine_verdict_delete` | `verdict` |
| `machine_verdict_update` | `verdict` |
<!-- board-triggers:end -->

`machine_item_start`, `machine_item_state` and `machine_item_move` guard lifecycle states and moves. `machine_fields_*` requires each state's fields; `machine_proof_*` requires its proof. `machine_item_delete` keeps item rows, while `machine_verdict_*` and `machine_event_*` make those records append-only.

Each connection also has a temporary `moving(token INTEGER)` table and `status_through_moves` trigger. The trigger allows status changes only while `moveItem` holds the token; these objects are not stored in the board file.

<!-- temp-columns:start -->
| Table | Column | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moving` | `token` | `INTEGER` | `nullable` |
<!-- temp-columns:end -->

<!-- temp-triggers:start -->
| Trigger | Table |

| `status_through_moves` | `item` |
<!-- temp-triggers:end -->

## Event log

The `event` table is a SQLite schema object governed by `SCHEMA_VERSION`; its append-only record format has the independent `EVENT_LOG_VERSION`. Each event has an increasing integer id, an ISO timestamp, the actor, the event kind, an optional item id, and a JSON object in `event_detail`. Board moves append their event inside the same immediate transaction as the move. Events are append-only; board triggers reject updates and deletes. The actor column is the acting agent id, except guard-repair events, which use `board`. Each event by a registered agent also carries a `model` string snapshot in `event_detail`; legacy agents without a declaration use `unknown`. This common snapshot is separate from the per-kind payload fields listed below. The following rows name the emitted kinds and the union of their operation-specific detail keys:

<!-- events:start -->
| Kind | Actor | Detail fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `join` | joining agent | `lane`, `route` |
| `family` | agent | `family` |
| `moved` | coordinator | `path` |
| `add` | item creator | `lane`, `specIds`, `after`, `route` |
| `edit` | editor | `brief`, `route`, `criterion`, `check`, `unfrozen` |
| `escalate` | builder | `from`, `to`, `note`, `attempt` |
| `attempt` | reporting agent | `n`, `seconds`, `result` |
| `claim` | builder | `leaseUntil`, `digest` |
| `renew` | builder | `leaseUntil`, `digest` |
| `release` | builder | — |
| `submit` | builder | `commit`, `tree`, `policyCommit` |
| `reserve` | reviewer | `until` |
| `accept` | reviewer | `reason`, `commit` |
| `reject` | reviewer | `reason`, `commit` |
| `merged` | coordinator | `commit` |
| `withdraw` | coordinator | `reason` |
| `refreeze` | coordinator | `before`, `after` |
| `hold` | coordinator | `lane`, `reason` |
| `unhold` | coordinator | `lane` |
| `guards` | board | `missing`, `changed`, `stale` |
| `shout` | sender | `shout`, `to`, `decision`, `request`, `answers` |
| `pass` | coordinator | `shout`, `to`, `decision`, `request`, `answers` |
| `answer` | answerer | `shout`, `to`, `decision`, `request`, `answers`, `outcome`, `channel` |
| `row_decision` | person | `record`, `channel` |
| `row_apply` | coordinator | `events` |
<!-- events:end -->

New CLI claims include a `policy` object (`version: 1`, `commit`) in the frozen criterion. It pins the coordinator checkout’s committed configuration on its attached main branch. A temporary detached review checkout refuses new policy-dependent claims or project gates with `NO_POLICY`; the coordinator returns to its main branch. Existing frozen submissions remain verifiable. Legacy claims use their recorded claim-base commit. A CLI `submit` records the pre-merge coordinator HEAD as optional `policyCommit`; historical doctor and acceptance checks use this snapshot when allowing unchanged foreign files brought in from MAIN. Verified dependencies may also contribute unchanged files in their own lanes before a MAIN merge; foreign deletion or replacement is not authorized by an unrelated dependency’s tree. The complete candidate diff against both claim base and frozen MAIN is checked with rename detection disabled, preserving deleted paths and whitespace in names. Frozen item checks run against the exact submitted commit in an isolated checkout when accepting and auditing; repairing a reviewer’s checkout cannot make a red submission green.

Person answer events additionally record their `channel`, either `terminal` or `view`, including the forwarded answer to the original asker. Agent answers omit that field.

Person row decisions use one `row_decision` event per row. Its `record` holds `kind` (`spec` or `doctrine`), file, id, exact source and replacement lines, target text, decision, reason and identity. SSH approvals additionally hold the canonical signature and trust anchors. The current index is additive `board_meta` key `row_decisions`; each entry includes its event id, timestamp and applied state. Coordinator `row_apply` events name the exact decision event ids applied locally. Replica replay changes board metadata only and never writes checkout files.

An approval of proposed new wording uses that same record: `source` is the existing exact line and `replacement` carries the approved target text. Pre-commit compares the staged target against the person decision or a verified staged signed receipt. No second approval format or event kind is needed.

Migration preserves event rows and adds only schema objects that are missing.

The schema, trigger and parser tables in this guide are checked against live `openBoard(':memory:')` and `parseSpec` results by `docs/formats.test.js`.
